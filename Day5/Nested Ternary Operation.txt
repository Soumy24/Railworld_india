                      Ternary Operator in Java

A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes a block of code based on the result
of the condition.

It's syntax is:

condition ? expression1 : expression2;
Here, condition is evaluated and

if condition is true, expression1 is executed.
And, if condition is false, expression2 is executed.
The ternary operator takes 3 operands (condition, expression1, and expression2). Hence, the name ternary operator.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // take input from users
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter your marks: ");
    double marks = s.nextDouble();

    // ternary operator checks if
    // marks is greater than 40
    String result = (marks > 40) ? "pass" : "fail";

    System.out.println("You " + result + " the exam.");
    s.close();
  }
