                                  Interface in java

An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the
behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behavior. A Java interface contains
static constants and abstract methods.

                               What are Interfaces in Java? 

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods
in the Java interface, not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple
inheritances in Java using Interface. In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract
methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.

When we decide on a type of entity by its behavior and not via attribute we should define it as an interface.
- Uses of Interfaces in Java are mentioned below:

It is used to achieve total abstraction.
Since java does not support multiple inheritances in the case of class, by using an interface it can achieve
multiple inheritances.Any class can extend only 1 class, but can any class implement an infinite number of
interfaces.
It is also used to achieve loose coupling.
Interfaces are used to implement abstraction

                         Difference Between Class and Interface

Although Class and Interface seem the same there have certain differences between Classes and Interface.
The major differences between a class and an interface are mentioned below:
