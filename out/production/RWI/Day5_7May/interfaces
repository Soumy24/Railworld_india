                                   Interface
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.


The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

How to declare an interface?
An interface is declared by using the interface keyword. It provides total abstraction; means all the methods in an interface are declared with the empty body, and all the fields are public, static and final by default. A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.

Syntax:

interface <interface_name>{

    // declare constant fields
    // declare methods that abstract
    // by default.
}
