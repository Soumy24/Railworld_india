                                  Class

A class — in the context of Java — is a template used to create objects and to define
object data types and methods.
-Classes are categories, and objects are items within each category.
-All class objects should have the basic class properties.

A class declaration is made up of the following parts:
-Modifiers
-Class name
-Superclass (the name of a class’ parent, if available)
-Implemented Interfaces (if any)
-Appropriate Keywords depending on whether the class extends from a Superclass and/or
 implements one or more interface
-Class body within curly brackets {}

                                 Object

A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class. Each object has an
identity, a behavior and a state.

The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display
the object’s behavior. Objects are created at runtime from templates, which are also known
as classes.

There are three steps to creating a Java object:

1) Declaration of the object.
2) Instantiation of the object.
3) Initialization of the object.
