Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types
of data types in Java:

1. Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and
double.

2. Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.
Java Primitive Data Types

In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are the most
basic data types available in Java language
a. boolean data type
b. byte data type
c. char data type
d. short data type
e. int data type
f. long data type
g. float data type
h. double data typ

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.
Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc
