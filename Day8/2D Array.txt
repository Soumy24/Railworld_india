                                Two-Dimensional Array in Java


A two-dimensional array in Java refers to a data structure that sorts elements in a grid-like manner. 
This grid consists of rows and columns and enables the developers to organize and manipulate data in a 
2D fashion. 

Unlike a 1D array, a 2D array allows storing and accessing data in a two-dimensional manner. It provides a
convenient way to work with data organized in a matrix-like structure. By utilizing nested loops, you can 
iterate over the rows and columns of a 2D array to perform operations on its elements. 

The syntax for declaring a two-dimensional array in Java is as follows:

dataType[][] arrayName = new dataType[rows][columns];


Here is a Java program that creates and initializes a two-dimensional array:

public class Apps
 {
    public static void main(String[] args) 
{
        // Create a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns

        int[][] matrix = new int[3][4];

        // Initialize the elements of the array

        matrix[0][0] = 1;
        matrix[0][1] = 2;
        matrix[0][2] = 3;
        matrix[0][3] = 4;

        matrix[1][0] = 5;
        matrix[1][1] = 6;
        matrix[1][2] = 7;
        matrix[1][3] = 8;

        matrix[2][0] = 9;
        matrix[2][1] = 10;
        matrix[2][2] = 11;
        matrix[2][3] = 12;

        // Print the elements of the array

        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) 
          {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) 
            {
                System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");

            }

            System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after each row
        }
    }
}

                                         ---------------------------
